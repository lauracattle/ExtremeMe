# ExtremeMe

This repository stores data that I find of interest regarding historic daily temperatures in Leeds.
I have used extreme value analysis to understand the thresholds for extreme cold days.
This allows me to understand if the extreme colds are changing over time as well as use this uncertainty as inputs into other extreme scenario forecasting.
